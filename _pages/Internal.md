### Background

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites written in Ruby. 

You can create blog posts and pages with dynamic content. All files can be created as markdown files and published wir github with no HTML needed except for dynamic content. 

The github repository of this site is located here: [https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io](https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io)

### Usage

1. **Create your profile** at [_data/authors.yml](https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io/blob/master/_data/authors.yml)  [(possible fields here)](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/authors/)
2. **Add an avatar** if you like at [assets/images](https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io/tree/master/assets/images). Note: It needs to be square.
3. **Create content** 
  - [_posts](https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io/tree/master/_posts) are the main type of content this site is for.
  - [_projects](https://github.com/zidatalab/zidatalab.github.io/tree/master/_projects) are cumulative collections of posts with some background. So projects aren't created all the time..

### Ressources

- [Learn Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
