### Projections

We are projecting COVID-19 in Germany since Mid March 2020. Results may be obtained from our Internal Dashboard for KV-/KBV-Users. Contact us to [gain access](https://www.zi.de/meta/kontakt-und-anfahrt/).

### Dashboards

We created two Dashboards with assessments of the current state of COVID-19 in Germany:

**Public Dashboard**

This dashboard is written in `R` and based on `flexdashboard` (only javascript) and hosted on github pages:
